        <h2><b>Configuring Microsoft Graph Security Data Inputs</b></h2>

        <b><i>NOTE</i></b>: <b>Configuration</b> and <b>Inputs</b> have changed in the new version 1.1.0. In the previous version 0.1.1, Application ID and Client Secret are entered directly under the <b>Inputs</b> tab. In the new version 1.1.0, these app credentials won't appear under the <b>Input</b> tab but are required to create an app account under the <b>Configuration</b> tab. 
		<ol>
          <li>
            From the list of Splunk apps, select <b>Microsoft Graph Security API Add-On for Splunk</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Under the <b>Configuration</b> tab, select <b>Account</b> tab. Then click <b>Add</b> to create an account. Give your account a unique Account Name, and enter Application ID, Client Secret that you already registered.
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Give your data input a unique name.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set an interval greater or equal to 300 seconds. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Select an index to store your alerts.
          </li>
          <li>
            From the steps above, enter your Azure Tenant ID.
          </li>
          <li>
            [Optional step] Set OData filter if needed â€“ check list of <a href="https://aka.ms/graphsecuritycuratedqueries">curated query samples</a> for ready to use Microsoft Graph Security API queries.
          </li>
 		  <li>
            For App Account, select an account from the list of the app accounts you've already created under Configuration tab. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Click <b>Add</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now you can search and create Splunk dashboards using your Microsoft Graph Security Alerts.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <b><i>Note</i></b>: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            The first time an input is created, it will pull as many Microsoft Graph Security alerts as possible. Then all subsequent requests will pull alerts with the lastModifiedDateTime between the set interval and the current time.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you create multiple inputs, the Add-on will have a multiple data streams from the Microsoft Graph Security API resulting in duplicate alerts.
          </li>
        </ul>
 
        <i>Optional</i>: <b>Configure Proxy settings</b>
			If you have Splunk and relevant add-ons running behind a proxy server, follow these additional steps. Refer to the following diagram for details.
		<ol>
          <li>
            Go to the <b>Configuration</b> tab of the add-on.
          </li>
           <li>
             Enter your proxy information under the <b>Proxy</b> tab.
          </li>
           <li>
             Click <b>Save</b>.
          </li>
        </ol>
		The Add-on will now use your proxy settings.
